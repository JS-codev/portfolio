<ins>**Main Purpose**</ins>
- The Arduino ultrasonic sensor will collect the water percentage of how much the cup can be poured on
- It will also collect temperature as well
- Once it collects these data, it will be sent to the SQL database.

**Hardware componets:**
- Laptop
- Arudino Board with shields (to connect Ethernal cables for SQL)
- Ultrasonic sensor
- Temperature sensor
- Buzzer
- button
- LED

**How it works:**
- The Arduino ultrasonic sensor will detect the distance between itself and the water level in the cup
- When water level increases, distance decreases and Arduino will display an increase of percentage of water level
- It will also send in real-time both temperature and percentage water level data to an SQL database.
