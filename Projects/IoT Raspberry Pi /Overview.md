<ins>**Main Objective of this project:**</ins>
- Collect and monitor temperature that is above 100°C inside injection moulding. If the temperature inide injection moulding is too high (200°C), the materials can be damaged. If it is too low (<100°C) , moldings may crack due to residual stresses.
- The most stable temperature should be around 120°C to 180°C
- Galvanize Python to collect temperature data from the NTC Thermistor through the use of the Raspberry Pi board. 
- The data will be displayed via the Raspberry Pi LCD screen. 

**Hardware componets:**

- Laptop
- Python 
- Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) thermistors 10k Ω 
- Raspberry Pi board 
- Display touchscreen for Raspberry Pi 

**Why use NTC thermistor instead of normal termpature?**

NTC thermistor has negative temperature coefficient (Higher temperature = Higher resistance)
A normal thermistor would only be limited to reaching a temperature of 100°C inside an injection moulding. But NTC thermistor can reach up to 200°C.
