The goal was to train a model to detect malware in any Android APK file with the highest accuracy possible. 

**Setup:**
- I opened a Jupyter Notebook and imported the necessary libraries, such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

**Data import:**
- I then imported a CSV file containing a comprehensive dataset of Android APK files.

**Data cleaning:**
- I cleaned the dataset by removing duplicate entries and handling missing values, such as Null or NaN. This ensured the dataset was consistent and ready for analysis.

**Exploratory data analysis:
- I examined and printed the Class column using the value_counts method. The results showed that the value 0 appeared 599 times, while the value 1 appeared 302 times.
- Here, 0 represents non-malware, and 1 represents malware. This means the dataset contains 302 malware samples and 599 non-malware samples.

**Feature & Target Variables:**
- I assigned the independent variables (features), which contain all columns except for name and class column to X and the target variable (Class column) to y.
- The X (features) represents the attributes of each APK file, where each row corresponds to a data point, and each column is a feature . The y (target variable) contains the labels where 1 indicates malware and 0 indicate non-malware

**Model Initalization:**
- I imported the KNeighborsClassifier model and the train_test_split function from the scikit-learn library.
- I split the dataset into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split, where 80% of the data was used for training, and 20% was reserved for testing.

**Training the model:**
- To start training the model, I initialized the k-NN model with k=3, meaning the model considers the 3 closest data points in the feature space to classify a new data point.
- I then trained the model using the model.fit method, passing in X_train (features) and y_train (labels) to prepare it for making predictions.

**Model Evaluation:**
- Finally, I evaluated the model's  performance using the model.score method, passing in X_test and y_test. This method returns the mean accuracy result after it tests the trained model by making predictions on the X_test dataset and comparing them with the true labels in y_test.
- The model achieved a mean accuracy score on test data of 0.88, indicating it correctly classified 88% of the test samples.

**Visualization:**
- To better understand the model's performance, I imported ConfusionMatrixDisplay from scikit-learn to visualize the confusion matrix, which provides a graphical representation of the test results.


- In conclusion, after training the model with K-nearest neighbor, the model's accuracy is 88% at detecting andord apk  malware files.
