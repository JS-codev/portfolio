**Adjusted R-squared** 
- If you have 3 data set, the **adjusted R-squared** measures how well your model fits the data. However, it penalizes the use of variables(3rd data set) that are meaningless for the regression.
- It is usually smaller than R-squared value (since it gets rid of variable like 3rd data set)

Adj. R-squared obtained:	0.772
