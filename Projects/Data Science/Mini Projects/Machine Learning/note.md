We use **Scikit-learn** (SKlearn) for machine learning

- **Supervised Learning**: Algorithms like linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVMs)
	- inputs (features used to predict outcome)
	- target (the correct values we are aiming for)

- Scikit-learn (or sklearn) itself is not a model, but a framework.
- Scikit-learn is a library that provides a variety of tools and algorithms to build machine learning models such as decision trees, linear regression, K-nearest-nenighbour.
